# This script will execute a series of fio based IO tests against a targeted
# directory specified in its execution. This test will create a very large
# file that is double (2x) the size of the physical RAM on this system to
# ensure that we are not just testing the caching at the OS level of the
# storage.
#
# NOTE: We recommend you stop all services before executing this script and
# will be prompoted to do so.
#
# RESULTS: This test is meant to provide guidance and is not a hard-and-fast
# indicator of how your Satellite will perform. For more information please
# see this KCS here:
#
# https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3397771
#
# Generally you wish to see on average 100MB/sec or higher in the READ test.
#  - Local SSD based storage should values of 600MB/sec or higher.
#  - Spinning disks should see values in the range of 100-200MB/sec or higher.
#  - Note that the random READ/WRITE results are expected to be much slower.
#  - If you see values below this, please open a support ticket for assistance.
